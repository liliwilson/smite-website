### Overview

Here's Rowan McDonnell (an elite club and professional player) with a great introduction to the vertical stack. Our focus is mostly on the cutting aspect; Rowan also gives important perspectives about handling in a vert stack and generating motion from the front of the stack. Keep these in mind as you develop as a player!

Watch the video and answer the following questions:
- What spaces on the field are “created” with vert stack?
- From which two positions can you initiate downfield cuts?
- Offense is all about space. As a cutter, where should you clear? How should you clear?
- What other options besides open-side unders does vert stack allow for?

### Examples

We're first going to analyze a possession from the 2016 Club Nationals final. I encourage you to watch through the entire video below a few times (Boston Brute Squad in dark, Seattle Riot in light) before moving on. Riot executes a pretty clinical vertical stack offense. Watch how the Riot players at the back of the stack (right side of the screen) provide options to both sides and clear space for other cutters.

Time to break it down. Keep in mind Brute Squad is forcing flick (although their marks are quite flat at points, possibly a team strategy), so the open side is the side closer to the camera.

In the above sequence, **downfield cuts are initiated from the back of the stack**. The first cutter makes an open-side under cut, gets faked off by the handler, and **clears deep**. The second cutter makes another open-side in cut, and the third cutter recognizes the opportunity to cut to the break side. Seeing this, the second cutter **clears to the middle of the stack**.

Remember, clear how you cut; this opens up space and allows for other cuts to develop. The two usual options are to clear hard deep or to the middle of the stack.

Let's move on to the next sequence, involving a well-executed under cut. Pay attention to the right edge of the screen.

{% include youtube.html src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0FZV4JahvjQ?si=7T8U8sNruUacvqd_&amp;clip=UgkxnhJgaZLfAXyAIDlKNOX9T5S8zp-WAkTo&amp;clipt=EPDpFhi8pBc" %}

Note the **cut shape**: the player **pushes deep** and then **cuts towards the thrower at an angle**. This makes the cut hard to defend and easy to throw to. We want to avoid horizontal open-side cuts aimed directly at the sideline, since they signficantly decrease the viable throwing window.

Also, see how the **entire stack shifts downfield** as the cut is completed. Even before the Riot player has caught the disc, the offense starts to push. The back-of-stack offers a **continuation cut** deep but is looked off.

Next is an example of a strong break-side continue cut off of handler movement. First watch the completed throw; then go back and try to figure out *why* the play developed the way it did.

{% include youtube.html src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0FZV4JahvjQ?si=0s1qTwWonrY2Pyfn&amp;clip=UgkxfxoySsCsP1Q1tA0lRmpcgIeh8vs5WRX7&amp;clipt=EOi_FxjA9hc" %}

The above play starts with a handler cut ("wheel" or "blow-by"). This cut changes the angle of attack, and during the couple of seconds in which the mark is recovering to seal off the break side, the break side is wide open. The back-of-stack cutter notices this and **times their cut off of handler movement**. Timing continuation cuts off of other cuts and backfield swings generates useful offensive flow.

At the beginning of the clip, notice how there were two under cuts, one to each side. Once it was obvious they weren't going to be thrown to, the players cleared to the stack. This is what allowed the break-side continue cut to happen. As Rowan said, cutting is often very selfless. If your cut is not open or well-timed, clear at 100% to free up the space for your teammates.

Let's finish with a couple of short clips from the 2022 Club Nationals semifinals. These are examples of completed continuation cuts (and yes, that is Rowan McDonnell getting a layout D in the thumbnail).

An open-side under to another under (defense is forcing backhand):

And a break-side under to deep:

Importantly, the cutters **set up their cuts** by faking one way and abruptly changing direction. This is crucial for creating separation from their defenders. The player in the last clip also starts their deep cut shallow, giving plenty of time for the thrower to put the disc out into space.

### Conclusion

Learning ultimate strategies takes repetition. Try to implement the above vert stack principles and experiment with different cuts. Any offense also requires field awareness. If you go back and watch where cutters are looking, you'll see them swiveling their heads and paying attention to the active cutter, which spaces are open, where the disc is horizontally, what the handlers are doing, etc. Start doing these things at practice!

This is just the beginning of our film study journey, and we are only scratching the surface of ultimate strategy. If you want to watch more ultimate, the full Brute Squad vs. Riot game is a wonderful place to start.
