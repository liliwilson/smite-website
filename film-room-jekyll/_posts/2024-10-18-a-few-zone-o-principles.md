abstract: Some basic zone offense concepts from the 2024 College Nationals final.

### Overview

Zone O is a unique and exciting system to play. It requires high frisbee IQ, and watching film is a great way to get familiar with common actions, reads, and plays. To start, read these summaries of zone O principles:

### Examples

Let's dive into film. We'll break down 10 short clips (two different POVs from the ESPN broadcast and drone footage).

A little background: this 2024 College Nationals final between UNC Pleiades and Stanford Superfly was preceded by two nail-biting semifinals. Stanford had just upset the #2 seed Vermont Ruckus largely due to their suffocating zone defense. UNC was set to defend their title for the third time in a row, and with a rock-solid offensive line, they patiently worked their way through Stanford's zone. 

Stanford forced the UNC O-line to throw *a lot* of throws. I mean, A LOT. But UNC remained patient and chose to take easy options. In the college women's division, making big over-the-top throws is risky and not utilized very often, so I'll focus on analyzing ways to work the disc around and through the cup/wall. 

Stanford's zone looks like a 3-person wall with two wings, a short deep, and a deep deep. The wall changes their force as the disc swings, typically forcing middle. UNC chooses to overload the backfield with 4 handlers (same as our zone O!).

#### 1) Open-side crash and through
Here's an open-side crash by a handler. They close the distance between them and the wall, allowing for a throw through. The popper does a great job positioning themselves between two defenders. Note how all the poppers are spread out, covering a large area downfield.

#### 2) Breaking the mark and overloading the wing
UNC breaks the mark around, and before the wall can recover, a popper attacks the space in front of the disc. The wing is overloaded by two poppers, allowing for significant yardage gain with a continue pass.

#### 3) Dragging wing out of position and swing to score
A similar sequence happens here. UNC attacks the around to break the zone. Importantly, before the initial swing, a popper drags the wing out of position towards the middle of the field. Remember, an offense in motion is much harder to defend, so poppers should strategically overload or move defenders.

#### 4) Countermotion and through
A universal concept in ultimate is countermotion. We always want to pair one option with another, making it difficult to shut down all threats. Once the disc is swung to the middle of the field, the Stanford defense anticipates another pass continuing in the same direction. A UNC player makes a cut in that exact direction, but another player counters the momentum, threatening an inside throw through. Again, recognize how important the setup is; the short deep is dragged out of position at the beginning by a popper, opening up the inside space.

#### 5) Following the throw and reading the defense
For handlers in zone O, following your throw is crucial for continuing lateral momentum as well as creating opportunities for countermotion. In this case, UNC finds a nice hole through. The popper reads the defense, realizes they are 1v1 in open space with the defender positioned too far on one side, resulting in an easy score.

#### 6) Swing to open-side crash and through
More exemplary use of horizontal space! We see the open-side crash pattern again. This clip also illustrates why moving the disc quickly is advantageous; watch the middle defender in the wall. They don't attempt to cover the throw through at all, possibly because they have no idea where their short deep is positioned. The short deep is likely expecting the wall defender to exert more pressure on the throw. Consider a stagnant offense in the same position - the defense would be much more aware of which spaces their teammates have covered.

#### 7) Breaking the mark and swinging ahead of the cup
UNC breaks the mark and simply swings the disc faster than the defense can keep up. Note how the popper's casual movement occupies the attention of both the wing and deep deep.

#### 8) Throwing over the wing
This is a great example of a high-completion throw over the second level of defense, especially after the handlers move the disc around the wall.

#### 9) Finding holes
UNC repeats the pattern of crashing into the cup and finding holes between defenders. The middle popper pulls the wing slightly out of their zone, and the far popper positions themselves well to receive a throw through.

#### 10) Offense in motion
Lastly, a clinical display of zone O in motion off of the pull. See if you can point out the common patterns described above!
