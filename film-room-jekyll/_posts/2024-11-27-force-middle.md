### Overview

A traditional force middle switches the mark to always force to the middle of the field. However, modern FM defenses look to force the disc back to the thrower, sealing and opposing motion on every throw. 

### Principles

**1) Marks are flat on the sideline.**

Flat marks make it more difficult to gain yards directly upfield. The goal is to force the offense to break the mark or take wide swings. 

Corollary: Cutter defenders need to orbit on the flat side to pressure the inside-out lane. For example, when the force is backhand on the flat side, defenders should still be on the “flick side” of their person because they are “orbited” to be between the most likely throw and their person. This is always true, not just in this defense.

**2) As the disc swings horizontally, run hard to seal and switch the force.**

Remember good marking technique: check upfield if you can to spot threats first and take a wider angle to cut off break throws. It is important to get on the mark quickly because downfield defenders will be vulnerable immediately following a swing.

Left to right swing, marker works hard to seal and switch the force:

Right to left swing, mark switches the force:

Two smaller horizontal passes, both times the mark works to seal off the direction the disc is moving towards:

Shorter left to right swing. Mark seals and switches force even though it doesn't cross half field:

**3) Reposition early downfield.**

Cutter defenders need to be aware of the mark switching and orbit to remain in the correct position. It should be fairly intuitive to some degree, and sometimes you don't even have to orbit that much. For example, let's say the disc is on the right sideline and the mark is flat. Cutter defenders are already orbited to the “flick side” anyways, so if there's a swing past half field and the force switches to flick, you're already in the correct position. But there are cases with longer swings where you do need to orbit to the other side. Two examples are shown below. 

Long right to left swing, cutter defenders orbit:

Two consecutive left to right swings = long left to right swing. Cutter defenders orbit:

### Additional Notes

- FM defenses have gained popularity in recent years with many top college teams adopting FM as a primary defensive scheme. All clips are taken from a [2023 CU Mamabird game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flx30iz4Hss).
- **Sideline talk** is really important. Success is dependent on everyone echoing calls when the force switches. "Home" and "away" calls are crucial as reminders for the mark, as well as for downfield defenders to decide if they need to orbit. 
- Switching. Lot's of handler switches happen on wheel cuts and flat side resets. They serve to stifle more dangerous horizontal continues off initial movement.
