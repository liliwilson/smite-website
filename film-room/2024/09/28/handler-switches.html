  <h1 class="post-title">Handler Switches</h1>
  <p class="post-author">Vincent Fan</p>
  <p>Going to write down some thoughts and provide some clips of examples of switching on handlers, as well as how to exploit them as the offensive player. We will cover two types of switches: switching on the strike cut, and switching on wheel cut, especially on the flat side.</p>

<p>What is a switch? A handler switch generally occurs when the defender marking the thrower switches off the thrower and onto the reset handler making the reset cut. The original reset defender then goes to defend the original thrower. Let’s first see that in the context of a strike cut.</p>

<p>In the above clip, the light player bounces the disk to #4 and cuts upline. The original defender of #4 (who was already poached into the lane) switches onto the player making the upline cut, and the other defender sets the mark.</p>

<p>Q: When does this switch usually happen?</p>

<p>A: This switch usually happens on a strike cut after a give and go, since the defender of the striker was just marking and cannot get to the force side. It usually does not happen if the defender on the reset is already positioned correctly.</p>

<p>Q: How to communicate this switch?</p>

<p>A: Typically, the reset defender who has “lost” their person should call for the switch by saying “roll!” or “switch!”. The other defender should then drop step (?), open their hips to the person making the upline, and guard them. Crucially, you cannot be lazy when you’re switching onto the person making the upline, for reasons we will see later. The defender not originally guarding the striker should generally not call for the switch, but they should be anticipating the possibility of a switch. Ideally, we can achieve good defender chemistry as a team and almost always switch in this scenario.</p>

<p>Q: How do you attack the switch?</p>

<p>A: Break the mark!</p>

<p>In the above clip, the person making the strike cut senses a switch is coming. Instead of continuing their upline cut which would be guarded, they stop and wait for the inside throw. This is a very common pattern in higher level play. As a corollary, the defense should avoid giving up this throw by being more heads up after the switch is called for.</p>

<p>In the above clip, the person making the upline makes a great hesitation move after the switch happens. Then they beat their new defender deep and receive a great away shot.</p>

<p>Now let’s discuss switches against the wheel cut on the flat side.</p>

<p><img src="/film-room/assets/images/wheel-switch.gif" alt="Switching on a wheel cut" /></p>

<p>In the above clip, the handler is on the flat sideline against a flick force. The off handler cuts directly behind them to get the reset throw. The primary difference from the other switch is that in this case, we allow the throw to happen, since the offense is losing yards straight back.
The original mark steps forwards to set the new mark. The original reset defender calls for the switch, and can generally stay in the same spot and wait to attach to the original thrower as they clear out of the space.</p>

<p>Q: When does this switch happen?</p>

<p>A: This specific switch happens against wheel cuts that go directly behind the thrower because the disk is on the flat sideline. You can also switch on the wheel cut in the middle of the field, except the marker will have to work to seal since the new reset will gain yards towards the breakside.</p>

<p>Q: Who should call for this switch?</p>

<p>A: I personally think both players can call for the switch.</p>

<p>Q: How to attack this switch?</p>

<p>A: Break the mark!</p>

<p><img src="/film-room/assets/images/around-after-switch-1.gif" alt="Attacking a switch with an around break" /></p>

<p>After the switch happens, the player without the disk has access to a large breakside lane. The thrower is able to break the mark with an around to this key space on the field, and the player runs onto the disk. Depending on the specific configuration of the defenders, the inside is also sometimes available.</p>

<p>Here are two more examples, from a different camera angle. The first is from a forehand force and the second is from a backhand force. The throw is pretty hard to get right.</p>

<p>Caveats: nothing I say in these documents is completely correct.</p>
